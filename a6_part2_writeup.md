## Question 4: Adding Features

If you could add TWO more features to improve your house price predictions, what would they be and why?

**Feature 1:**
Amount of floors

**Why it would help:**
More floors would dictate better the size of the home possibly increasing the price and leaves more space and areas to store things

**Feature 2:**
Possible issues 

**Why it would help:**
It would help because its not uncommon to get a house with some problems to get a discount while negotiating and fix the issues later. Houses that are aged are bound not to be perfect.

## Question 5: Model Trust

Would you trust this model to predict the price of a house with 6 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms, 3000 sq ft, and 5 years old? Why or why not? (Hint: Think about the range of your training data)

**YOUR ANSWER:**
I would trust this model as the range of error is so miniscule that any budget should be able to account for it fairly easily, It may only be off by a couple of hundred dollars. not much compared to the price of the home that you were already prepared to pay for.
